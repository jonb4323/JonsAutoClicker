# JonsAutoClicker
This is the best auto clicker ever made, clean functional GUI with a ton of funtions.

Features
Adjustable Click Interval
Easily control the speed of your clicks by customizing the time interval between each automated click. Whether you need rapid-fire clicks or slower, deliberate presses, JonsAutoClicker can handle it.

Customizable Hotkeys
Set up global hotkeys to start and stop the auto-clicking from anywhere. This allows seamless toggling without having to focus the application window.

Click Position Picker
Choose exactly where you want the clicks to occur. You can manually select specific screen coordinates or use a built-in tool to pick positions visually.

Status Indicator
Stay informed with a real-time status display that shows whether the clicker is active or idle, helping you avoid unwanted clicks.

Built with C# in Visual Studio
Fully developed using C# on Visual Studio, leveraging Windows Forms for the user interface. The codebase is clean, modular, and easy to extend.
