# JonsAutoClicker
This is the best auto clicker ever made, clean functional GUI with a ton of funtions.

**Features** <br/>
Adjustable Click Interval
Easily control the speed of your clicks by customizing the time interval between each automated click. Whether you need rapid-fire clicks or slower, deliberate presses, JonsAutoClicker can handle it.

Customizable Hotkeys <br/>
Set up global hotkeys to start and stop the auto-clicking from anywhere. This allows seamless toggling without having to focus the application window.

Click Position Picker <br/>
Choose exactly where you want the clicks to occur. You can manually select specific screen coordinates or use a built-in tool to pick positions visually.

Status Indicator <br/>
Stay informed with a real-time status display that shows whether the clicker is active or idle, helping you avoid unwanted clicks.

Built with C# in Visual Studio <br/>
Fully developed using C# on Visual Studio, leveraging Windows Forms for the user interface. The codebase is clean, modular, and easy to extend.
